      <Card title="Travel Insurance">
        Seminar on the Seas strongly encourages the purchase of Travel
        Insurance. All payments made for a Reservation are non-refundable at the
        time of payment.
        <br />
        <br />
        Though insurance may be purchased up to 48 hours prior to sailing, to
        secure the broadest coverage, including pre-existing conditions, Travel
        Insurance must be purchased within 14 days of the payment of your
        deposit.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Travel Documentation">
        Seminar on the Seas strongly recommend that all guests travel with a
        valid passport with at least six (6) months validity during their
        cruise. <br />
        <br />
        This greatly assists guests who may need to fly out of the United States
        to meet their ship at the next available port should they miss their
        scheduled embarkation in a U.S. port; guests entering the U.S. at the
        end of their cruise; and guests needing to fly to the U.S. before their
        cruise ends because of medical, family, personal or business
        emergencies, missing a shipâ€™s departure from a port of call, involuntary
        disembarkation from a ship due to misconduct, or other reasons.
        <br />
        <br />
        Guests who need to fly to the United States before their cruise ends
        will likely experience significant delays and complications related to
        booking airline tickets and entering the United States if they do not
        have a valid U.S. passport with them.
